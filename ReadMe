There are two kinds of datasets, i.e., bytecode on Ethereum and labeled ground truth(CodeSmell.csv).
You can found byte code at : https://drive.google.com/open?id=19m2ZWXI9HeJk81WSKeoFd0q3cIXEjcLF ; There are two files in this zip; hashcode stores all distince bytecode, which is identified by a hash value. You can find the related contract addresses on hashaddr.

Analysis Result.txt.zip is the analysis results of the smart contracts on Ethereum. Each distinct bytecode is identified by a hash value. Related contract addresses can be found on our dataset.
The SmellDetector tool will be released after the paper is published.
